The 24th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2018) was held in Lille, France between August 27 and 31 this year.

We are happy to have 3 papers from our group accepted for presentation at the main conference. Here they are.

- [Automatic Discovery and Exploitation of Promising Subproblems for Tabulation](/files/fulltext/2018/Automatic Discovery and Exploitation of Promising Subproblems for Tabulation.pdf)
- [Metamorphic Testing of Constraint Solvers](/files/fulltext/2018/Metamorphic Testing of Constraint Solvers.pdf)
- [Automatic Generation and Selection of Streamlined Constraint Models via Monte Carlo Search on a Model Lattice](/files/fulltext/2018/Automatic Generation and Selection of Streamlined Constraint Models via Monte Carlo Search on a Model Lattice.pdf)

We had 5 papers in the workshops that were colocated with CP:

- "Modelling Langford's Problem: A Viewpoint for Search" by Özgür Akgün and Ian Miguel at [ModRef 2018](https://modref2018.github.io/)
- "Memory Consistency Models using Constraints" by Ruth Hoffmann, Özgür Akgün and Susmit Sarkar at [ModRef 2018](https://modref2018.github.io/)
- "Towards Solving Essence With Local Search: a Proof of Concept Using Sets and Multisets" by Saad Attieh, Christopher Jefferson, Ian Miguel and Peter Nightingale at [ModRef 2018](https://modref2018.github.io/)
- "Graph connectivity via local minimality" Fraser Dunlop, Peter Nightingale and András Z. Salamon at the [International Workshop on Graphs and Constraints](http://gt-im-ia.gforge.inria.fr/cp2018.html)
- "Expression of Graph Problems in a High Level Modelling Language" by Fraser Dunlop, Jessica Enright, Chris Jefferson, Ciaran McCreesh, Patrick Prosser and James Trimble at the [International Workshop on Graphs and Constraints](http://gt-im-ia.gforge.inria.fr/cp2018.html)

And 2 papers by our PhD students at the Doctoral Program. The doctoral program is a great opportunity for them to meet their peers, get feedback, and receive mentoring from a more senior member of the community. I had enjoyed attending to it at CP 2010 - 8 years ago already!

- "Maximal Frequent Itemset Mining with Non-monotonic Side Constraints" by Gökberk Koçak
- "Local search of Essence, a proof of concept" by Saad Attieh

In addition to presenting these papers, we also gave a tutorial on [Conjure](http://conjure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html) and [Savile Row](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/peter.nightingale/savilerow). This was a double act by myself and Peter Nightingale, who is the main developer of Savile Row.
