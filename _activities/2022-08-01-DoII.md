I recently became the Director of Impact and Innovation for the School of Computer Science, starting in August 2022.

This is an administrative role which includes, among other things, coordinating the impact case studies our unit of assessment will submit to the next Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise. If you are not an academic in the UK you may not know about the REF (lucky you!) but if you are an academic in the UK there is no way you don't know about it...

I will represent the School in several University level meetings and I am hoping to get a better understanding of how the institution as a whole operates through this role.
