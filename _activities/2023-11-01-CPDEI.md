I was asked (and accepted) to become the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion chair for the CP conference in 2024.

This is a shared post with Maria Andreina Francisco Rodriguez from the University of Uppsala for the 2024 conference. Andreina was also a co-chair for the 2023 conference. The DEI chair is organised to have overlapping terms like this to maintain continuity.

I presented some of the DEI work at the CP2024 conference in Girona. The talk was recorded and it is available [here](https://diobma.udg.edu/handle/10256.1/7774).
