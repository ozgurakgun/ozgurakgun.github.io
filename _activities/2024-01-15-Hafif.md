We recently started a Youtube channel with my good friend Görkem Paçacı.

This is something we are mainly doing for fun, basically we enjoyed talking to each other and we thought we can also record and shared these - why not?

We came up with a simple format: we choose top post of the last week from [r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) and talk about them. We don't prepare very much for these, just our initial impresions and thoughts.

We also plan to have guests, cool people we know who are experts in their domain.

Oh, all of this is in Turkish, sorry! But I wanted to make a note here anyway.
