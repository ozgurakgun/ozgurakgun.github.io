[CREEM](https://www.creem.st-andrews.ac.uk/) is the Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling.

They develop statistical models to solve problems in ecology. We had talks by colleagues in CREEM and colleagues in CP (including myself).

It looks like there are a lot of opportunities for collaboration between the two groups. More to follow...

[Here](https://blogs.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/csblog/2024/06/17/first-away-day-between-constrained-programming-group-and-statistical-ecology-group-held-over-the-summer/) is a bit more info about the day on the CS School blog.
