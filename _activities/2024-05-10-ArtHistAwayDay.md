We had an away day where we brought researchers from the Schools of CS and Art History together. This unlikely combination gave rise to some interesting discussions.

Researchers from both Schools gave talks. I talked about our Data Linkage work, focusing on linking individuals on historical records. There are opportunities for similar kinds of applications in art history, turns out.

There were some interesting talks by our art historian colleagues as well. In the first instance, it seems, they might benefit from some automated image/pattern recognition. Not exactly my expertise or research interest, but we have collagues in CS who can be a good fit.

This was an interestign experience - I think it is worth taking the time out of our routine work schedules and think outside the box.
