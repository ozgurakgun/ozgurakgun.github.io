The Turkish Consulate in Edinburgh ran an event titled "Turkish-Scottish collaboration in academia" at the St John's Church on Princes Street. This event brough together Turkish academics in Scottish universities (which there are more of than I thought there were!) and other academics in Scotland too.

It was a nice event and I did meet with a few fellow researchers during the event, which was great. However, I think without sustained communication it will be hard to maintain these connections.

Regardless, I applaud the Turksih Consulate for the initiative.
