I gave a talk on the Jupyter extension for Conjure at the Combinatorial configurations seminar. This seminar series is a long running event, as far as I understand, and sadly due to the [Russo-Ukrainian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War) had to be online this year.

There is some more information about the event, and a screenshot of all the participants including yours truly, on [this website](https://kntu.kr.ua/news/2462).

Thanks [Olexandr Konovalov](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/computer-science/people/obk1/) for the invitation.
