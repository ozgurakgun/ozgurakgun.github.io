This year we have quite a few contributions to the CP conference. Hence, we decided to have a day of mock talks, where we presented our papers to the AI research group at the School of Computer Science.

This gave our presenters a chance to polish their talks, receive early feedback and the members of the AI group who will not attend the conference a chance to listen to the talks. Great idea.
