We had a day of talks by the "AI for decision making" VIP students. See the [VIP](/vip) page for more details about this module.

This was the end of our third semester of the VIP, and students gave talks describing their work throughout the semester. This event was attended by the academics in the CP group at the School of Computer Science as well. It was a good celebration of the students' achievements.

The plan is to have these at the end of every semester.
