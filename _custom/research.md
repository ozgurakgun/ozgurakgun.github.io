I routinely serve as a program committee member and reviewer at top AI conferences (AAAI, IJCAI, ECAI), subject specific conferences (CP, CPAIOR, PADL), and AI journals (AIJ, JAIR). Notable cases of service can be seen on the [activities](/activities) page.

Please see my profiles on
[Orcid](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9519-938X) and
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=heG7k-gAAAAJ&hl=en) for my latest publications.

I also try to maintain a list here, but the profiles linked above may be more up to date.
