I am experienced in programming languages Haskell, Python, C++, C#, Java and web technologies (Javascript, CSS, HTML).

I am involved in the development of open source software.

- I am the main developer of [Conjure](http://www.github.com/conjure-cp), the automated constraint modelling tool.
- I contribute to the development of [Savile Row](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/peter.nightingale/savilerow) -- more often indirectly by making Peter Nightingale do a lot of (very cool!) work.
- I am a contributor to the awesome dependently typed programming language [Idris](http://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev).
- I am one of the editors-in-chief of [CSPLib](http://github.com/csplib/csplib).
- I am the developer of and a contributor to [DLRep](http://github.com/dlrep/dlrep).
