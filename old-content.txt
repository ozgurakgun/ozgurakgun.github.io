### Old Content

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
I am currently working on preparing a new personal web site.
But as you can guess this is taking a while...

The following is some old content copy/pasted from my old and very basic personal web site.
Please don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact) if you cannot find something you are looking for here.

    <h1> Hi! </h1>
    <p>
        I am Özgür Akgün, and you've reached my academic homepage. I
        exist on several other places throughout the internet, this is
        the <em>serious</em> one.

    <h1> Contact </h1>
    <p>
        If you wish to contact me about a research related topic, or
        just to say hi, or you simply want to send me presents, you
        can use the following contact details. E-mail is usually the
        fastest and most convenient way (for me!).

    <h1> About </h1>
    <p>
        My main research interest is on automating the constraint modelling process.
        I am the main developer of a software tool called <a href="http://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure"> Conjure</a>
        whose goal is to automatically produce Essence' constraint
        models to problems given in Essence. Essence is a very high
        level problem specification language. Essence' is a solver
        independent constraint modelling language.
        See <a href="http://conjure.readthedocs.io">Conjure's documentation</a> for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also interested in using Machine Learning techniques to solve real life problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently employed on the
        <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K015745/1">ADRC-Scotland</a> project, focusing on population reconstruction.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was previously employed on the
        <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K015745/1">Working Together: Constraint Programming and Cloud Computing</a> grant.

        I did my PhD under the supervision of <a
        href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/computer-science/people/ijm/">Ian Miguel</a> and
        <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/computer-science/people/caj21/">Chris
        Jefferson</a>. We also have strong collaborations with <a
        href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~frisch">Alan Frisch</a>
        from University of York and <a
        href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=2oRyj9QAAAAJ&hl=en">Brahim Hnich</a> from
        Izmir University of Economics. My studies were generously
        funded by The <a href="http://www.sicsa.ac.uk"
        rel="nofollow">Scottish Informatics and Computer Science
        Alliance (SICSA)</a>.

        Prior to my studies in University of St. Andrews, I attended
        <a href="http://www.ieu.edu.tr/en">Izmir University of
        Economics</a> to receive 2 B.Sc. degrees: <a
        href="http://ce.ieu.edu.tr/en">Computer
        Enginnering</a> and <a
        href="http://ie.ieu.edu.tr/en">Industrial
        Systems Engineering</a>. There, I have done courses on <abbr
        title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>, <abbr
        title="Operations Research">OR</abbr> and Heuristics amongst
        many others. We were lucky enough to present the results of
        our final project (together with 2 friends and our supervisor
        <a href="http://homes.ieu.edu.tr/~agokce">Mahmut Ali
        Gokce</a>) at <a href="http://www.euro-2009.de">EURO-2009</a>.

        I received scholarships during my undergraduate education
        thanks to my success in the nation-wide university entrance
        exam in Turkey. I was at the top 0.62% amongst more than 1.5
        million participants.
